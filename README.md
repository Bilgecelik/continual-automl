Scripts and original results files for the paper "Adaptation Strategies for Automated Machine Learning on Evolving Data". The graphs in the paper are also provided. Data is available on OpenML. For each library, there are 6 different options representing the following adaptation strategies:
  
 - AS-0 Detect & Increment
 - AS-1 Detect & Retrain
 - AS-2 Detect & Warm-start
 - AS-3 Detect & Restart
 - AS-4 Periodic Restart
 - AS-5 Train once

Details of the strategies can be found in the original paper.
